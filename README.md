# Better Overload ![active installs](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://rl-plugin-shields.klisiu.net/active-installs/betteroverload&color=green)
This plugin is an improvement on the overload timer from the timers plugin because it accounts for world lag.
The issue with the overload timer from the timers plugin is that the timer can be off when the world lags, this makes it a lot harder to brew on the tick when the overload stat restore happens. 

Other than that it also gives you the option to display the timer in ticks or decimals, instead of just in seconds. Lastly the timer will flash green on the stat restore tick (every 15 seconds or 25 ticks).
